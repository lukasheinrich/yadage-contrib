# yadage-contrib
small-scale contributions to the yadage workflow engine

This repository is meant to hold small code examples / snippets that are interesting uses / extensions to yadage, but have not spun out yet as standalone packages with their own repo -- similar to [Flask Snippets](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/).

## Contibuting

To contibute, please fork this repo, craete a new branch and commit your snippets / code to that branch. The structure is meant to be light-weight, just create a new apprpriately named directory. If you want you can add your contributions to this README with a short 
description.
